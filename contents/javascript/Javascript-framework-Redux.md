## What is Redux

Redux is a library that manages application state in JavaScript applications. If you visit Redux's website, they'll say they're a predictable state container. You use it together with view libraries, such as React. React isn't the only thing that works with Redux, there's also Vue and Redux etc.

### Wait, what's application state?

Think of it like a global object holding information that you use for various purposes in the application. You need to keep store of whether a user is logged, or what items are currently in a to-do list. That's state.

Modern web applications have massive state.

## How does Redux work?

### Store

### Action

### Reducer

### UI

## Why Redux

### Easier debug and inspect
#### Redux dev tools

### Trivial implementation of functionality

### Something about no worry about race conditions

## Why Not Redux

There are many sites and articles speaking of why you shouldn't or when you shouldn't use Redux.

Most of the main ideas are
1. Reasonable amount of data changing over time
1. You need a single source of truth
1. Keeping everything in a top-level parent component is not enough

### Alternative state managers
